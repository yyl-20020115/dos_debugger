/// <summary>
/// Maintains a call graph among a collection of the procedures.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// For each procedure call, the disassembler generates a xref object
/// with the following fields:
/// 
///   Source  = Address of the CALL or CALLF instruction
///   Target  = Address of the entry point of the target procedure
///   Type    = NearCall or FarCall
///   AuxData = not used; potentially could be used to store the data
///             address of a dynamic call instruction
/// 
/// In our call graph, we keep track of the entry point of the calling
/// procedure and the called procedure, as well as the location of the
/// CALL/CALLF instruction. Therefore the above xref is transformed
/// into the following xref and stored:
/// 
///   Source  = entry point address of the calling procedure
///   Target  = entry point address of the called procedure
///   Type    = NearCall or FarCall
///   AuxData = Address of the CALL/CALLF instruction
/// 
/// As a result of the above arrangement, each CALL/CALLF instruction
/// generates one edge in the call graph, and there may be multiple edges
/// between two procedures if it is called more than once. When the call
/// graph is displayed to the user, it is often desirable to keep just
/// one edge between any pair of procedures.
/// </remarks>
