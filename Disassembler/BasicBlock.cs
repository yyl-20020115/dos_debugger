/// <summary>
/// Represents a basic block of code.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A basic block is a contiguous sequence of instructions such that in a
/// well-behaved program, if any of these instructions is executed, then
/// all the rest instructions must be executed.
/// 
/// For example, a basic block may begin with an instruction that is the
/// target of a JMP instruction, continue execution for a few 
/// instructions, and end with another JMP instruction.
/// 
/// In a control flow graph, each basic block can be represented by a
/// node, and the control flow can be expressed as directed edges linking
/// these nodes.
/// 
/// For the purpose in our application, we do NOT terminate a basic block
/// when we encounter a CALL instruction. This has the benefit that the
/// resulting control flow graph won't have too many nodes that merely
/// call another function.
/// 
/// A basic block is always contained in a single segment.
/// </remarks>
// TODO: we might want to make BasicBlockInfo struct to store, and then
//       make BasicBlock a wrapper around it with rich functionalities.
