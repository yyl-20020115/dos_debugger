/// selector is NOT the frame number as in real mode addressing.
/// 
/// The offset is a displacement value that references a byte within the

/// 
/// The special address FFFF:FFFF is used to denote an invalid address.
/// 
/// While 16 bits is adequate to address a byte, it is not sufficient to
/// express an 'end' index, which is often used in ranges. Therefore, we
/// use 32 bits to store the offset. This also allows for future extension
/// to 32-bit disassembly.
///
/// Addresses in different segments are not related. However, certain
/// tasks will be much simplified if a total order is defined on the

/// 
/// 1) When displaying all the instructions in a LoadModule, it is useful
///    to arrange the segments sequentially in the order that they appear
///    in the image.
/// 2) When using a RangeDictionary to associate ranges of bytes to a
///    value, it is easier to use one single RangeDictionary than using
///    a separate RangeDictionary for each individual segment.
