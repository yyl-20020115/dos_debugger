/// <summary>
/// Represents a custom URI used to address a byte in an assembly.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// An AssemblyUri has the following format:
///
/// ddd://assembly/type/name/offset
///
/// All parts are mandatory except 'offset', which defaults to zero. The
/// URI components are explained below.
/// 
/// "ddd":
///   Protocol; stands for "_dos _debugger and _decompiler".
///
/// assembly:
///   Format: "exe" N   or   "lib" N
///   where N is a zero-based index that uniquely identifies an assembly
///   within the session. N monotonically increases for each assembly
///   opened in the session.
///   
///   We use an index to represent an assembly so that we don't need to
///   worry about escaping file names or handling duplicate file names.
///   
///   The 'assembly' part serves as the base address from which bytes
///   within the assembly can be references without explicitly specifying
///   the assembly.
///   
/// type & name:
///   Specifies an IAddressReferent object. Supported types and their
///   formats are described below.
///   
///   'type'='seg' -- segment.
///   'name' must be one of the following:
///     (1) decimal number: specifies the one-based index that uniquely
///         identifies the segment within the assembly.
///     (2) module.name: fully qualified name of the segment. Neither
///         module nor name may contain a dot. If multiple matches are
///         found, throws UriFormatException.
///     (3) name: (without dot) if the name is unique within all modules,
///         specifies that segment; otherwise, throws UriFormatException.
///   'offset' is relative to the beginning of the segment.
///   
///   'type'='sym' -- symbol.
///   'name' specifies the symbol name.
///   'offset' is relative to the location of the symbol.
///    
///   'type'='sub' -- procedure.
///   'name' specifies the name of the procedure.
///   'offset' is relative to the entry point of the procedure.
/// 
///   'type'='*' -- wildcard.
///   'name' specifies one of the above names, and the handler tries to
///   resolve it.
///   
/// offset:
///   Hexidecimal offset of the location within the segment. No prefix
///   or suffix should be added to indicate that it is hexidecimal. 
///   Leading zeros are not mandatory. Negative offsets are not supported.
///   
///   If the offset specifies a position in the middle of an instruction
///   or data item, the handler automatically chooses a suitable position
///   instead to display the location.
///   
/// It is helpful to think of a URI as one would expect to input and get
/// a result in a GOTO dialog.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// ddd://exe1/seg/1/0              first byte of segment 1
/// ddd://lib1/seg/_ctype._TEXT/0   first byte of _TEXT segment of _ctype module
/// ddd://lib2/sym/_strcpy/0        starting address of symbol '_strcpy'
/// ddd://exe2/sub/sub_01234/0      entry point of procedure 'sub_01234'
/// ddd://lib3/*/__exit             search for something named __exit
/// </example>
